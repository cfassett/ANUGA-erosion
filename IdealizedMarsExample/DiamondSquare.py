    """Runs a diamond square algorithm and returns an array (or list) with the landscape

        An important difference (possibly) between this, and other implementations of the 
    diamond square algorithm is how I use the roughness parameter. For each "perturbation"
    I pull a random number from a uniform distribution between min_height and max_height.
    I then take the weighted average between that value, and the average value of the 
    "neighbors", whether those be in the diamond or in the square step, as normal. The 
    weights used for the weighted sum are (roughness) and (1-roughness) for the random
    number and the average, respectively, where roughness is a float that always falls 
    between 0 and 1.
        The roughness value used in each iteration is based on the roughness parameter
    passed in, and is computed as follows:

        this_iteration_roughness = roughness**iteration_number

    where the first iteration has iteration_number = 0. The first roughness value 
    actually used (in the very first diamond and square step) is roughness**0 = 1. Thus,
    the values for those first diamond and square step entries will be entirely random.
    This effectively means that I am seeding with A 3x3 grid of random values, rather 
    than with just the four corners.
        As the process continues, the weight placed on the random number draw falls from
    the original value of 1, to roughness**1, to roughness**2, and so on, ultimately 
    approaching 0. This means that the values of new cells will slowly shift from being
    purely random, to pure averages.


    OTHER NOTES:
    Internally, all heights are between 0 and 1, and are rescaled at the end.


    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    size
        The size of the grid to be returned. If an integer is passed, the return grid will
        have sides of this length. If an array-like is passed, the first two values will be 
        used as the array shape.

    min_height
        The minimum height allowed on the landscape

    max_height
        The maximum height allowed on the landscape

    roughness
        A float with value between 0 and 1, reflecting how bumpy the landscape should be. 
        Values near 1 will result in landscapes that are extremly rough, and have almost no
        cell-to-cell smoothness. Values near zero will result in landscapes that are almost
        perfectly smooth.

    random_seed
        defaults to None. If a value is given, the algorithm will use it to seed the random
        number generator, ensuring replicability.

    AS_NP_ARRAY
        A boolean reflecting whether the landscape should be returned as a numpy array. If set
        to False, the method will return a 2-dimensional list.


    RETURNS
    -------
    A 2-D numpy array or 2-D list with a diamond-square "height-map"
