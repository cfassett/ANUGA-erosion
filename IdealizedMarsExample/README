This is an example scenario for an idealized lake terrain

The only required parameter is the lake radius.  All other parameters, including  grain size, are set in model_params.py.
Optional parameters are an initial lake depth multiplier (-m) and initial breach depth/head (-i).

Default is for depth to scale based on lake volumes in FH2008. (However, this is probably too conservative because this is the post-flood 
volume and virtually every factor will reduced volume after these lakes overflowed).

Example call, sort of Jezero-y:
  python lakeerodeR.py 20000 -i 10
