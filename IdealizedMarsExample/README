This is an example scenario for an idealized lake terrain

The required parameters are the lake radius and grain size (both in meters).
Optional parameters are an initial lake depth multiplier (-m) and initial breach depth/head (-i).

Default is for depth to scale based on lake volumes in FH2008. (However, this is probably too conservative because this is the post-flood 
volume and virtually every factor will reduced volume after these lakes overflowed).

Example call:
  python lakeerodeR.py 4000 0.02 -i 6
